http_basic_auth
===============

This is a straight port of the HTTP Basic authentiction from Rails to Merb, it's used exactly the same way:

    class Application < Merb::Controller

      before :authenticate
  
      def authenticate
        authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic("login") do |username, password|
      
          username == "matta_" && password == "supersecret"

        end
      end

    end

Enjoy!
